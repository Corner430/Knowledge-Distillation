    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "- Since the quality of predictions varies among peers, **it is important to treat peers unequally** (Lan, Zhu, and Gong 2018).\n",
    "  - Unfortunately, naive aggregation functions tend to **cause peers to quickly homogenize, hurting the effectiveness of group distillation** (Kuncheva and Whitaker 2003; Zhou 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike naive group-based learning where all peers end up with similar behaviors, **trained peer models in our approach could be quite different from each other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A key design** of OKDDip is that each auxiliary peer assigns individual weights to all the peers during aggregation **to derive their own target distributions**. We incorporate an **attention-based mechanism** (Vaswani et al. 2017) to generate a distinct set of weights **for each peer** to measure the importance of group members. This allows large variation in derived target distributions and hence boosts peer diversity. **Note that asymmetric weights exist in our model**.\n",
